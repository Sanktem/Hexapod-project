This is a project to create a hexapod robot. I got the insperation from makeyourpet.com, and that is where a lot of the STL files are comming from because I'm bad at designing them, but I'm not wanting to use the phone that he has set up, and is wanting to make a way to add things to the robot to make it more useful for other things except for looking cool.

A lot of this will be a learning experiance for me, I'm new to a lot of these things so I will have to put this project on pause a lot to spend time learning things, and it will cost a lot in parts to get everything.

TODO: (This is in on speical order but are seperated by section)
Create a website that I can control the bot
    [] First: Control one leg with variable control from the website
    [] Secound: Add control for more then one leg, and to move the robot
    [] Extra: Add in a way to view a camera

Create the Bot
    [X] Build one leg
    [] Build frame and connect the leg
    [] Build and design the eletronics to contol the leg
    [] Design the rest of the body, and design a build for the eletronics in the body
    [] Build the rest of the legs
    [] Add expandablity for Cameras, radar detection, gps, etc

Program the ESP32 microcontroller
    [(kinda i got it working on an Arduino but not on the ESP32)] Control the one leg
    [] Connect the leg controls to the website
    [] Once the rest of the legs are built, create a walking cycle for the legs
    [] Program turning of the bot, while moving and not moving
    [] Create a way to easily to create additions
    [] Add a camera

Misc
    [] Create a bill of materials
    [] Recreate STL files for all the changes that will be needed for the different devices
